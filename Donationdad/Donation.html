<h1>Welcome to my donation page!</h1>
<p>Hello, my name is Marco.

<p>I created this page to start a donation to help me fight my Lymphedema. Graphic pictures of my actual legs in their current condition are below, WARNING please view with caution.

<p>I was born February 5th, 1951, and I'm the father of five children and two step sons. I grew up in New York City most of 
my life, and ever since I was young, I wanted to have children and a great paying job to help support them whenever they 
would come to me with any issues in their lives. As I got older I had gotten married not once, but a few times. Finally 
with my ex-wife and now my current wife, we conceived our children over the last 30 years, and I deeply enjoy spending time 
with them more than anything in the world.

<p>As I started working over the last 40 years with multiple jobs, First as an alarm technician in NYC for 22 years until 
the company went out of business. After that, I was a restaurant manager until I retired, and a newspaper delivery agent for 12 years. I started 
to become very ill with a disease. This disease slowly grew and spread throughout my waist, legs, and feet, and it's been 
hard to enjoy the things I once loved before this took over my life.<br>

<p>I've been struggling with Lymphedema since 2012, it's now going into 2019. Lymphedema, is fluid build up in the feet, legs 
and waist. The heart pumps lymph fluid at the same time it pumps blood throughout the body. As person gets older, the heart 
has a hard time pumping lymph fluid and blood. When the lymph fluid gets to the very bottom of a persons body, the heart 
can't pump it back up to recirculate throughout my body. Therefore, the fluid remains in the feet and legs, and eventually builds 
up into the waist. If not treated the fluid can get to the lungs and heart, causing congestive heart failure.
I've been to the Kingston wound care center for 4 years,the Northern Dutchess wound care center for 3 years, and currently
still going there for treatment. I've been to the Northern Dutchess Hospital and Vassar Bros multiple times in the past 2 years for serious infections in my feet and legs caused by this lymedema disease. I've also been to Golden Hill Rehab clinic in Kingston,NY, to receive intravenous antibiotics to control the serious infections
caused by lymphedema. According to the doctors I've been seeing for this medical problem, they claim there's no cure for 
lymphedema. It must be treated continually to keep it under control and I must be hospitalized when an infection is 
present. I could use all the help that I can get to pay for my on going treatments, traveling, and medical bills to avoid amputation.
